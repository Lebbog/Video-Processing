# Video-processing
A C# program that processes a video and identifies frames where the video encounters cuts, and frames where the video transitions gradually. The program takes either an AVI or MPG video file and processes frames 1000-4999. The video frames will be 
checked for cuts in the camera view, and gradual transitions. The video can then be played back to the user in segments based on the frames of cuts/transitions.
